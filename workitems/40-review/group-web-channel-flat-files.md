# Group channels/web/ 56 flat files into sub-directories

## Summary

`runtime/src/channels/web/` started this Stage 5 effort with 73 files sitting at the root level and is now down to 12 flat root files after three bounded grouping tranches. The layout is materially easier to scan and now satisfies the original root-count target.

## Current structure

```
runtime/src/channels/web/           56 files, 7,030 lines (flat)
runtime/src/channels/web/http/      21 files, 2,251 lines
runtime/src/channels/web/handlers/   5 files, 1,590 lines
runtime/src/channels/web/workspace/  9 files, 1,352 lines
runtime/src/channels/web/terminal/   1 file,    378 lines
runtime/src/channels/web/vnc/        1 file,    296 lines
```

## Proposed grouping

| New sub-dir | Files to move | Lines |
|---|---|---:|
| `auth/` | `auth-runtime.ts`, `auth-gateway.ts`, `totp-auth.ts`, `webauthn-auth.ts`, `webauthn-enrol-page.ts` | ~750 |
| `sse/` | `sse.ts`, `agent-events.ts` | ~650 |
| `messaging/` | `message-store.ts`, `message-write-flows.ts`, `agent-message-store.ts`, `agent-message-service.ts` | ~500 |
| `theming/` | `ui-theme-data.ts`, `ui-theme-commands.ts`, `ui-bridge.ts` | ~500 |
| `cards/` | `adaptive-card-actions.ts`, `interaction-service.ts` | ~300 |
| `media/` | `media-service.ts`, `avatar-service.ts`, `link-previews.ts` | ~800 |

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] No more than 15 files at the `web/` root level
- [x] All imports updated (no broken paths)
- [x] All tests still pass
- [x] Test file structure mirrors src structure where it is straightforward

## Notes

- Should be done **after** the WebChannel split (blocked-by) to avoid merge conflicts
- Pure file moves + import rewrites — no logic changes

## Updates

### 2026-03-27
- Repo-status audit refreshed the current layout counts to match the repo as it stands now.
- Ticket remains valid and explicitly downstream of `split-webchannel-god-class`; the flat root has grown to 56 files rather than shrinking.
- Quality: ★★★☆☆ 6/10 (problem: 2, scope: 1, test: 1, deps: 1, risk: 1)

### 2026-03-28
- Lane change: `10-next` → `40-review` via web next-card decision.
- Next-lane outcome recorded from the adaptive-card submission: **Move to Review**.
- Stage 5 execution now satisfies the ticket’s acceptance target, so the follow-up grouping ticket is promoted for review/closure rather than remaining in next.

### 2026-03-28
- Broad filesystem reorg sequencing now treats this as the active Stage 5 candidate.
- Current measured structure is worse than the older snapshot: 73 flat files at the web root, with grouped planning captured in:
  - `docs/stage5-web-channel-grouping-inventory-2026-03-28.md`
  - `docs/stage5-web-channel-grouping-steplist-2026-03-28.md`
  - `docs/stage5-web-channel-grouping-autoresearch-prompt-2026-03-28.md`
  - `workitems/50-done/execute-stage5-web-channel-grouping.md`
- Recommended first tranche is no longer “move everything blindly”, but to group the clearest semantic slices first: `auth/`, `sse/`, `cards/`, `media/`, `theming/`, and `messaging/`.
- The first manual tranche landed the six broad capability directories and reduced the flat root from 73 files to 47 files.
- A second manual tranche then grouped additional auth/agent/theming support files and reduced the flat root again, from 47 files to 32 files.
- A third manual tranche grouped endpoint/context helpers, runtime/follow-up/state helpers, and WebChannel constructor/contracts/surface helpers, reducing the flat root again from 32 files to 12 files.
- The ticket’s original acceptance target is now satisfied and the work is ready for review.
