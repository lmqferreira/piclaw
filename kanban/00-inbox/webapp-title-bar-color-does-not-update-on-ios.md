# Web app title bar color does not update on iOS

## Summary

On iOS Safari / standalone PWA, the web app title/status bar color does not reliably update when the theme changes.

Likely root cause is platform behavior/limitation: iOS only partially honors dynamic `theme-color` updates, especially in standalone mode.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Ensure both light and dark `theme-color` meta tags exist.
- [ ] Ensure `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` is set for installed mode.
- [ ] Ensure runtime updates of `meta[name="theme-color"]` occur on theme switch.
- [ ] Document iOS behavior as best-effort (may require reload/relaunch to repaint).
- [ ] Verify behavior on iOS Safari tab mode and iOS standalone PWA mode.

## Updates

### 2026-03-17
- Captured from BTW side-conversation outcome.
- Assessment: ticket is valid, but expected fix is primarily a compatibility hardening pass and documentation of iOS limitations.

## Notes

- iOS support for dynamic browser chrome coloring is inconsistent across versions and mode (tab vs standalone).
- Success criteria should be “best available behavior” rather than strict parity with desktop/Android.
